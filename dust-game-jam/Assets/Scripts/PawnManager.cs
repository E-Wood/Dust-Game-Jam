     * Hunger, Thirst, Sleep

     * once a task has been completed? Task information will be handled in a TaskManager
     * class
     * They will have tools - I wouldn't worry about implementing this until we have
     * most of the other stuff sorted
     * How many tools can a colonist have equipped?
     * Materials - will the colonists collect these or will the player collect them?
